## Problem
Telemedicine has become a major trend setter in the health care industry owing to the present circumstances. 
We are presenting an idea of a tele-consultation app which is trying to help its users to identify their 
health issues and reach out to the concerned doctors for consultation.

## Proposed Solution
AI based assistant which helps the user to find out to which illness his/her symptoms are pointing to and suggest the respective specialist category and recommend top doctors who are experts in their specialisation and help them connect to the doctors. A self-check on few of the today's top most medical conditions - Heart Health and Work Stress. Doctor on Demand - where users can book consultation of doctors, who would be coming to your home for consultation. Help the users to find the doctor specific to their common symptoms of illness. Help the users to connect to the doctors specific to the specialisation they ask for. Help them book OP consultation to the nearby hospitals.

## Future Enhancements
1. Payment Integration - User would be able to pay the consulation and other charges via online payment channel
2. Integrating booking of Lab tests - User would be able to select from a set to available tests and a few nearby scans, with the amount to be paid. Book a slot and technicians would be reaching patient's home to collect the samples 
3. Integrating booking of Scans and X-Rays - User would be able to see a list of scans and nearby scan centres, with the amount to be paid. Request callback from the selected centre for the selected scans, they will give back to get the details and set the time slot. 
4. Integrating Order Medicines - User would be able to upload the prescription. Prescription will be shared with the local partner pharmacy based on user's location. Delivery slot and amount will be shared by the pharmacy directly.
